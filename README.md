## About the Problem Statement - 

The dataset (excel sheet) provided contains complaints on Green Delhi App during 2024 and 2025. 

I performed the following analytics utilizing the data - 
-	What are the major types of sources that users reported? 
-	How many sources have been resolved during this period, and which type of sources have the most pendency? 
-	Highlight the departments and their complaint resolution performance 
-	Which region of Delhi reported the greatest number of complaints and which categories?  
-	Present any seasonal or monthly inferences 
-	Any other key observations or patterns in the data  
- If you were the Secretary of the Environment Department, Government of NCT of Delhi, how would you use this data to guide Delhiâ€™s clean air strategy?
